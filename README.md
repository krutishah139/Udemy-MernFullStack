# Udemy-MernFullStack

This is the project from my Udemy learning course. 

The website is named Emaily. Users can send out surveys to a list of emails provided by the user to gather information. The application uses Google Oauth to sign in
and save user profiles to a MongoDB Altas database. Users can purchase credits using an embedded Stripe credit card payment system. Once users have purchased
credits and sent out surveys, they can view the responses of their surveys in their account dashboard. 

Heroku is the platform used to deploy this website. The URL is the following: https://intense-mountain-83243.herokuapp.com/
